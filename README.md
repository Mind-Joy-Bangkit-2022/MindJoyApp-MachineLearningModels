#### Background

Although depression is not related to age, treating mental health from an early age is very important considering that it can affect children's behavior and psychology from childhood to adulthood. 9.7%) compared to adults aged 26-49 years (6.9%) and aged 50 years and over (3.4%). Everyone needs to have insight into mental health and how to prevent it, especially at an age that is prone to having psychological disorders. One of the factors why adolescents are at risk for psychological disorders is due to pressure to adjust to their peers, difficulty finding identity and identity crisis, as well as wrong perceptions obtained from the media they access.

#### Machine Learning : Builds 2 models consist of [mental health detection](https://github.com/Mind-Joy-Bangkit-2022/MindJoyApp-MachineLearningModels/tree/main/mental%20health), and [face expression classification](https://github.com/Mind-Joy-Bangkit-2022/MindJoyApp-MachineLearningModels/tree/main/emotion). Building the model using baseline model, and save the model to _model.tflite_ and chose the model for deployment.
